# Species phylogeny scripts

Purpose of these scripts are to produce a phylogeny of the cypriniform species
investigated in this project. This phylogeny is used to help control for species
relatedness when calculating the correlation between FiNZ-ZnF number and TE
content. It is also useful in making inferences about the origin of the FiNZ
domain itself.
