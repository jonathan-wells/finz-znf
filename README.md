# FINZ-ZNF project

In tetrapods, a large family of C2H2 zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are responsible
for repressing transposable element (TE) activity. They achieve this through the
activity of a potent N-terminal repressor domain, the Kr√ºppel associated box 
(KRAB), which recruits KAP1 and eventually leads to the deposition of H3K9me3
marks around the their target TE.

However, KRAB-ZNFs are restricted to tetrapods, but C2H2 ZNFs are nonetheless 
extremely abundant across all metazoans. In zebrafish, which has one of the most
diverse and abundant TE repertoires of any vertebrate, also possesses ~500 ZNF
genesi. The large majority of these contain an as yet uncharacterized N-terminal 
domain, named the Fish N-terminal Zinc-finger associated (FINZ) domain, and are 
clustered on chr4q. In this project I plan to investigate whether or not these 
FINZ-ZNFs are involved in TE repression.
